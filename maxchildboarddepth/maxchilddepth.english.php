It also affects which boards are included when the "Count sub-board\'s posts in parent\'s totals" option is enabled.<br><br>For example, if this is set to 1, a sub-board will only be marked "new" on the index page if the sub-board itself contains a new post. If it is set to 2, the sub-board will be marked "new" if there is a new post in the sub-board or in a sub-sub-board. If it is set to 10, the sub-board will be marked "new" if there is a new post in the sub-board, a sub-sub-board, a sub-sub-sub-board, etc., up to 10 levels deep.<br><br>Large, active forums may want to set this value to a low number in order to conserve server resources.';
